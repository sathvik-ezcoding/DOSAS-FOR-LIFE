Ingredients
2 cups rice, rinsed (recommended 1 cup medium-grained rice, 1 cup parboiled rice)
1/2 cup urad dhal, rinsed (split black lentils)
1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds (5-7 seeds)
Filtered water
1 tsp salt

Step 1:
Soak the rice. After rinsing the rice, place it in a large bowl and cover with water. Ideally, there should be about 2 inches (5 cm) of water above the surface of the rice to allow for absorption. Soak for about 6 hours.
